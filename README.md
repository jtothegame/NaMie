# NaMie

- NaMie is a web application I built as my idea for a final project during the CodeCore Bootcamp.  
- It's an app with a tinder-esque interface that allows users to signup, link their accounts together in a one-to-one relationship, and then view name cards for boys and girls names.
- They can choose whether they like or dislike each card and it will reveal the next name for them to review.
- Each name card is populated with data like meaning and history, pronunciation, related names and popularity ranking.
- At any point using the app users can go to the matches page to see any names that both members of their partnership have liked!
